## K-Means Clustering Without ML Libraries ##
K-Means Clustering is a machine learning tecnique used in unsupervised learning where we don't have labeled data. I wrote this algorithm without uing any of Machine Learning Libraries.

### How K-Means Clustering Algorithm Works? ###
- First algorithm creates k number of centers randomly.
- Than, all data points are labeled using nearest centers.
- Than, centers are moved to "mean" of their labeled data points.
- Than step 2 and 3 are repeated.
