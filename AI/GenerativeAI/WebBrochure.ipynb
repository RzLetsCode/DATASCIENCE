    "## First Step: Have GPT-4o-mini Determine Relevant Links\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a call to GPT-4o-mini to analyze the links found on a webpage and respond with a structured JSON output. The model should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decide **which links are relevant** for inclusion (e.g., About, Careers, Company pages).  \n",
    "- Convert **relative links** such as `/about` into full URLs like `https://company.com/about`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **one-shot prompting** by providing the model with an example of the desired JSON response format. This approach leverages the model's strong natural language understanding to perform complex filtering and URL normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use an LLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an excellent use case for a large language model because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It requires **nuanced understanding** of webpage link context that is difficult to hard-code.\n",
    "- Writing manual parsing and heuristics to identify relevant links is complex and error-prone.\n",
    "- The model can generalize to different websites and link structures easily.\n",
